Glory to Allah,Praise be to Allah,There is no god but Allah,Allah is greater [than all things],Allah bless Muhammad and give him salvation,There is no might nor power except in Allah,I seek the forgiveness of Allah,I seek the forgiveness of Allah my Lord and repent to Him,In the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful,I seek refuge in God from the exiled Satan
